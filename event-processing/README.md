# event-processing

This project contains source code and supporting files for creating the Event Processor and Audit serverless architecture.

### Event Processor
- event-processing/event-processor - Code for the application's Lambda function written in TypeScript.
- event-processing/events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function using SAM CLI (See below).
- event-processing/event-processor/tests - Unit tests for the application code.
- event-processing/event-processor-template.yaml - A template that defines the Event Processor AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions, SNS, Kinesis FireHose and S3. These resources are defined in the template files located in the event-processing and audit sub-folders. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

## Pre-requisites

- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - Used to build and deploy the application
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 14 - Recommended way to install is via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Required to run SAM locally and run integration tests
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) version 3 - The package manager for the project
- [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) - Scans cloud infrastructure configurations to find misconfigurations before they're deployed. Added as a Husky pre-commit hook.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=install) - For pre-commit and pre-push validations

Enable Git Hooks to be used with Husky. In the root of the project run the following command:
```bash
npx husky install
```

Also, if running on Linux you may need to make sure the Husky scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod ug+x .husky/*   
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

The deployment of the resources contained here rely on the following AWS System Manager Parameters being available in the event processing account:

* AuthAccountARN - Auth Root Account
* AuditAccountARN - Audit Root Account
* KBVQueueARN - SQS Queue for KBV events
* KBVAddressQueueARN - SQS Queue for KBV Address events
* KBVFraudQueueARN - SQS Queue for KBV Fraud events
* KbvKmsArn - KMS ARN used for at rest encryption of the KBV queue
* KbvAddressKmsArn - KMS ARN used for at rest encryption of the KBV Address queue
* KbvFraudKmsArn - KMS ARN used for at rest encryption of the KBV Fraud queue
* IPVCoreQueueARN - SQS Queue for IPV Core events
* IPVPassportQueueARN - SQS Queue for IPV Passport events
* IPVCoreKmsArn - KMS ARN used for at rest encryption of the IPV Core queue
* IPVPassportKmsArn - KMS ARN used for at rest encryption of the IPV Passport queue
* SPOTKmsArn - KMS ARN used for at rest encryption of the SPOT queue
* SPOTQueueArn - SQS Queue for SPOT events
* HECEndpoint - Splunk instance endpoint for FireHose instances
* HECTICFToken - Splunk token for the TiCF index
* HECPerformanceToken - Splunk token for performance index
* HMACKeyKMSKey - 32 Char string used for HMAC encryption
* HMACSecretArnParameter - ARN for the Secret Manager secret containing the string used for HMAC encryption

You can see these values being referenced throughout the event-processing-template file in the following format:

`"{{resolve:ssm:IPVCoreKmsArn}}"`

See the following on how to create the parameters via:

* [AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-create-console.html)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/param-create-cli.html)
* [Powershell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/param-create-ps.html)
* [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ssm-parameter.html)

## Deploy the sample application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Node.js - [Install Node.js 14](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
* Yarn - [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, create an S3 bucket to store the code, and run the following in your shell whilst in the event-processing folder:

```bash
sam build --template-file event-processing-template.yml --config-file config/samconfig-event-processing.toml --config-env "<environment name>"
sam deploy --config-file config/samconfig-event-processing.toml --config-env "<environment name>" --s3-bucket "<bucket name>"
```
*Note*: When deploying the event processor also include the `--resolve-s3` argument in order to automatically create an s3 bucket of the lambda zip.

*Deploying Locally*: When deploying locally you can specify the profile to be used for deployment by adding the profile argument e.g.

```bash
sam deploy --config-file config/samconfig-event-processing.toml --config-env "<environment name>" --s3-bucket "<bucket name>" --profile <aws profile name>
```

You can also provide overrides directly when calling sam deploy if you need to provide different parameters to the stacks:

```bash
sam deploy --config-file config/samconfig-event-processing.toml --config-env "<environment name>" --s3-bucket "<bucket name>" --profile <aws profile name> --resolve-s3 --parameter-overrides ParameterKey=AuditAccountARN,ParameterValue=<ARN of account IAM root> ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=<Environment>
```

*Note*: When calling SAM deploy against a template containing a Lambda function make sure to omit the template name argument. If this is not done, the source files will be deployed instead of the compiled files located in .aws-sam.

#### Available Environments

- dev
- build
- staging
- integration
- production

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
event-processing$ sam build --template-file event-processing-template.yml --config-file config/samconfig-event-processing.toml --config-env "develop"
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `event-processor/package.json`, compiles TypeScript with esbuild, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

The event type we use for the event-processor lambda is an SQSEvent.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
event-processor$ sam local invoke <Function-Name> --event invoke-events/event.json --env-vars invoke-vars/environment-vars.json --profile <dev acccount profile>
```
You can also test against a Lambda deployed into the Dev environment using the AWS CLI:

```bash
event-processor$ aws lambda invoke --function-name <Function-Name> --invocation-type Event --payload "<base64 encoded event json>" outfile.txt --profile <AWSProfileForTheTargetAccount>
```

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `event-processor/tests` folder in this project. Use YARN to install the [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/) and run unit tests.

```bash
event-processor$ cd event-processor
event-processor$ yarn install
event-processor$ yarn run test
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack-name>
```

You can find the stack names defined in the config file:

- event-processing/config/samconfig-event-processing.toml
