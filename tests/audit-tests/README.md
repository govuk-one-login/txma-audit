# di-txma-audit Audit Tests

## In this directory

This directory contains the automation tests for the Audit side of the TxMA service.
The tests have been written to ensure that all the components within the TxMA Audit account are connected and any messages which pass through are manipulated as expected.

The tests will test the configuration in the `dev`, `build`, and `staging` environments.

## Prerequisites

### GDS use

1. [A GDS AWS account](https://gds-request-an-aws-account.cloudapps.digital/)
2. [The GDS CLI configured](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli)

### Private use

1. [An AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email)

## Running locally

### Create your project

Firstly, clone the `di-txma-audit` repository, you will need to [deploy the audit AWS services](https://github.com/alphagov/di-txma-audit/blob/main/audit/README.md). Note, for GDS users, this is only needed for `dev` environment as all others will be deployed using the AWS Pipeline.

After this, navigate to the `di-txma-audit/tests/audit-tests` in your terminal or command line.

### Setting up your temporary credentials

You need to set your environment variables to match temporary credentials for your AWS account.

#### Using the GDS CLI
You can generate your temporary credentials for the build environment by using the following command:
```bash
gds aws di-txma-audit-build -e
```
and setting the access key, secret access key, and session token in the terminal. <br>
To do this, copy the output of the previous command and run them (paste) in the terminal or command line.

Our other event-processing accounts for these tests are:
`di-txma-audit-dev`
`di-txma-audit-staging`

#### Private use
For a private account, follow these [steps to set up temporary credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html).

## Running the script
Then, use the following gradle command to run the tests in the build environment. <br>
The `TEST_ENVIRONMENT` is the environment you are running the test in. <br>
The `TEST_REPORT_DIR` is the location of the output the reports

Mac:
```bash
export TEST_ENVIRONMENT="build"
export TEST_REPORT_DIR="report"
./gradlew clean test
```
Windows:
```bash
set TEST_ENVIRONMENT="build"
set TEST_REPORT_DIR="report"
gradlew.bat clean
```

To view the report produced, run the following command:
``` bash
open build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```
Or view one of the other produced reports in the `TEST_REPORT_DIR` directory.
