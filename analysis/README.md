# Analysis

This project contains source code and supporting files for creating the Analysis of the Audit system serverless architecture.

- analysis/analysis-template.yaml - A template that defines the Audit AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Glue, Athena and S3.

## Pre-requisites

The deployment of the resources contained here rely on the following AWS System Manager Parameters being available in the audit account:

* CSLSS3QueueARN - The queue to subscribe to the query results
* CSLSS3LambdaARN - The lambda to subscribe to the query results

You can see these values being referenced throughout the audit-template file in the following format:

`"{{resolve:ssm:CSLSS3QueueARN}}"`

See the following on how to create the parameters via:

* [AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-create-console.html)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/param-create-cli.html)
* [Powershell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/param-create-ps.html)
* [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ssm-parameter.html)


## Deploy the sample application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Node.js - [Install Node.js 14](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
* Yarn - [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, create an S3 bucket to store the code, and run the following in your shell whilst in the audit folder:

```bash
sam build --template-file analysis-template.yml --config-file config/samconfig-analysis.toml --config-env  "<environment name>" --profile "<aws profile name>"
```

*Deploying Locally*: When deploying locally you can specify the profile to be used for deployment by adding the profile argument e.g.

```bash
sam deploy --config-file config/samconfig-analysis.toml --config-env "<environment name>" --s3-bucket "<bucket name>" --profile "<aws profile name>"
```

You can also provide overrides directly when calling sam deploy if you need to provide different parameters to the stacks:

```bash
sam deploy --config-file config/samconfig-event-processing.toml --config-env "<environment name>" --s3-bucket "<bucket name>" --profile "<aws profile name>" --resolve-s3 --parameter-overrides ParameterKey=AuditAccountARN,ParameterValue=<ARN of account IAM root> ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=<Environment>
```

#### Available Environments

- dev
- build
- staging
- integration
- production

## Cleanup

To delete the application, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack-name>
```

You can find the stack names defined in the config file:

- audit/config/samconfig-audit.toml
